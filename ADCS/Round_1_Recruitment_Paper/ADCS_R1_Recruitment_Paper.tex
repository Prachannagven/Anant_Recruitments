	\section*{Question 1: The Hunt for the Cosmic Chronic}

\noindent \textit{Scene opens with Rick drunkenly scribbling on an old map while Morty nervously watches from the side.}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “Morty! MOR-TY! Look at this piece of interstellar gold! Found it in some dusty ass drawer in my lab. Says here it leads to the best f***ing weed on Earth—some primo cosmic kush, Morty. None of that legal dispensary crap. We’re talking divine-grade ganja, Morty. D-I-V-I-N-E! Some cosmic entity mapped this out, pointing to $(3182.655, 2000.94, 5135.159) km$ back on January 2, 1920, at 1420 VLAT—don’t look at me like that, Morty, it’s UTC+10:00, you little idiot.” \\

\noindent \textbf{Morty:} “Wait, wait, what are you even talking about, Rick? Why does the map matter? Can’t we just, like, drive there?” \\

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “Oh, yeah, sure, genius. Just f***ing drive there! Except this hill? Yeah, turns out it’s in the middle of nowhere, off-grid. And the f***ing coordinates? They’re in the Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed Frame. That’s right, Morty, we’re dealing with an Earth-Centric frame. Your midget-ass brain doesn’t even know what that is, does it?! ECEF is, uh… you know… fixed relative to the rotating Earth. It’s got an origin at Earth’s center of mass—big f***ing deal, right? You need to use this to figure out the latitude, longitude, and altitude of this hill. Oh, and while you’re at it, tell me what physical location on Earth this is! Chop-chop, Morty!” \\

\hl{$(a)$ Locate the hill using the ECEF coordinates $(3182.655, 2000.94, 5135.159) km$. Find the latitude, longitude, and altitude. Also, determine the physical location (i.e., name of the place) on Earth.}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{(A few hours pass, Morty calculates furiously, then Rick comes back with a teleporter.)} \\

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “Good news, Morty! We don’t need to hoof it. We’ve got this sh***y divine teleporter that came with the map. Bad news? The lazy celestial a**hole that made it didn’t bother accounting for Earth’s rotation. So guess what? The m*****f****** teleporter only accepts coordinates in the Earth-Centered Inertial Frame. Yeah, that’s right, the ECI Frame, Morty. You know what ECI is? I’ll tell you what it f***ing is. It’s a frame fixed to the stars, unaffected by Earth’s spinning—like my tolerance for your stupidity. And, conveniently, ECI and ECEF align perfectly every day at 1200 GMT. That means the Prime Meridian and equator line up exactly at noon GMT like some kind of cosmic clockwork.”\\

\noindent \textbf{Morty:} “So, uh, what do you want me to do, Rick?”\\

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “What do I f***ing want? I want you to convert the hill’s coordinates from ECEF to ECI for right f***ing now! Use today’s time, Morty, and don’t screw it up! We’ve got some intergalactic dankness waiting, and I’m not waiting around for your f***-ups.” \\

\hl{$(b)$ Convert the hill's position intot he Earth-Centered Inertial Frame for today's date and time. Use the assumption that ECEF and ECI align perfectly at 1200 GMT daily.}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{(Morty does the conversion, but when they teleport, they end up in deep space.)} \\

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “Oh, for the love of fu***** ch***t Morty! You worthless bag of human meat! What did you do? I told you to convert the coordinates to ECI, but you used Earth’s current position, didn’t you? Didn’t you?! Morty, you can’t just convert the coordinates like that! The Earth back then—yeah, you know, 1920, when the map was made—was in a different f***ing position in space! The ECI frame is anchored to the stars, Morty, not the planet spinning on its tiny-ass axis today.”\\

\noindent \textbf{Morty:} “I-I thought it wouldn’t matter, Rick! I mean, how different could it—”\\

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “Shut up, Morty! I’ll explain, but only because I’m surrounded by idiots. The Earth’s position back then needs to be parameterized in its orbit around the Sun. Picture this, Morty: the Earth’s elliptical orbit, where the origin is at the center of the Sun. The \( z \)-axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane, pointing north, and the \( x \)-axis is toward the Sun at perihelion. Got it?”\\

\noindent \textbf{Morty:} “N-not really…”\\

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “F*** you*! I’m not done! I’ll calculate Earth’s position back in 1920 and its position now, using celestial mechanics way above your comprehension level. Once I’ve got the Earth’s orientation in 1920, you’ll re-convert those coordinates to ECI from back then and input them into the teleporter! Otherwise, we’re gonna be floating in space until you die, and trust me, I’ve got better things to do!”

\bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “And hurry up, Morty! If you f*** this up one more time, I’m dumping you on a random planet and smoking the whole stash myself!” \\

\hl{$(c)$ Parameterize Earth's position in its orbit for January 2nd, 1920 at 1420 VLAT (UTC+10:00). Re-convert the hill's coordiantes to the ECI frame of 1920 and input them into the teleporter.}

	\section*{Question 2 - F*** Physics, We’re Smoking Stars!}

\noindent \textbf{(Rick and Morty are still floating in space after Morty’s last screw-up. Rick is furiously tinkering with the teleporter, while Morty nervously looks at the flashing “ERROR: COORDINATE MISMATCH” on the screen.)}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “Morty, I’m about two nanoseconds away from strapping you to this teleporter and using you as a human gravity anchor! Do you have any idea how badly you f***ed up?! We’re stuck out here in the cosmic a**h*** of the universe, Morty, and guess what? YOU are gonna fix it!” \\

\noindent \textbf{Morty:} “B-but Rick, I don’t even know what I did wrong! I just punched in the numbers like you said!” \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “F***ing exactly! That’s the problem, Morty—you’re all punching and no thinking. Fine. You want a way back? You’re doing orbital dynamics homework now, you little dipsh***. Here’s your first problem!”

\bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “Okay, listen up, Morty. There’s this planet over there in a nice little circular orbit, and we’re stuck in another circular orbit. Now, to get to that planet, we need to pull some fancy orbital maneuvering—real rocket scientist s***, Morty. No teleporters, no shortcuts, no bulls** magic m*****f*****. I want you to figure out the two burns we need to get there.”
\bigskip

\hl{$(a)$ Figure out how much $\Delta V$ we need for both burns for going from an orbital altitude of 200km to 2000km.}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “Alright, Morty, you figured out the baby orbit. Congrats, you’re officially smarter than a rock—but only barely. Here’s the kicker: sometimes, going way out of your way can actually save fuel. That’s right, Morty, instead of just hopping straight to the target, we’re gonna overachieve and swing out to a huge-ass intermediate orbit before dropping back down to the target. Think of it like a galactic victory lap, Morty—except it’s not for fun, it’s for fuel efficiency!”
\bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Morty:} “Wait, Rick, why would that even work? Doesn’t that waste more fuel?”
\bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “Oh my god, Morty, why don’t you just tattoo ‘I’m stupid’ on your forehead and save me the trouble?! Look, sometimes going farther out gives you a better angle or less energy loss. I’m not here to explain the f***ing why—just calculate the burns! One to leave the starting orbit, one to enter the outer orbit, and one to finish up at the target. Here’s your hint, Morty! Three burns, three orbits. Go do the math while I sit here regretting my entire existence.”

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “Oh, great, Morty, just great! We’re in another f***ed-up universe! You know how gravity works with $F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$? Yeah, well, not here, Morty! In this sh***y corner of the cosmos, gravity scales with $r^{-3}$. Imagine that, Morty! The universe decided, ‘Hey, let’s screw with physics just to piss Rick off!’”

\section*{Question 3: Lost in Space, Screwed by Science (and Worm Goo)}

\noindent \textbf{(Morty is floating in space, clutching the half-broken GPS tracker that Rick gave him before they were separated. A flickering hologram of Rick is berating him for poking a dangerous glowing space worm.)} 

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Morty:} “Oh man, Rick! I-I don’t know where I am! One second we were fine, and then the worm sucked us into its dimension, and now I’m floating in space! HELP!” \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Rick (Hologram):} “First off, Morty, I TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH THE WORM! But nooo, you couldn’t resist. And now you’re stranded in deep space, tumbling around like a f***ing cosmic piñata. Great job, Morty. Just great.” \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Morty:} “I-I thought the worm was harmless, Rick! It was just sitting there glowing! You didn’t tell me it could explode into a vortex!” 

\bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “You’re gonna have to use that busted GPS I left you. It’s not much, but it’s all you’ve got. Alright, Morty, let’s start with something simple. The GPS tracker I gave you has a pinging system. It sends a signal to satellites, and they bounce it back. Basic f***ing physics. I gave you the coordinates of three satellites before you decided to turn a worm into a dimension grenade. Here they are:”

\begin{center}
Satellite A: (-3141, -5926, 5358) \\
Satellite B: (-9793, 2384, -6264) \\
Satellite C: (3383, -2795, -0288)
\end{center}


\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “But here’s the thing: there’s a fourth satellite that I didn’t give you the coordinates for because—let’s be honest—you don’t deserve them. You’re gonna have to figure out its position. Lucky for you, I made sure none of the satellites are in the same octant. Oh, and for the missing satellite, symmetry is key—its \(x, y, z\) coordinates are probably all the same.” \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Morty:} “B-but Rick, how do I even know where I am?!” \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “Oh my god, Morty, are you even listening? I gave you ping times for all four satellites! Here they are:”
\[
t_A = 23.90987365 \, \text{ms}, \quad t_B = 51.57336220 \, \text{ms}, \quad t_C = 21.79227717 \, \text{ms}, \quad t_D = 14.96656189 \, \text{ms}.
\]

\hl{$(a)$ Use all of the given data to figure out two things: $(i)$ where Morty is and $(ii)$ where the fourth satellite is.}

\bigskip

\noindent \textbf{(After managing to calculate his position and the missing satellite’s coordinates, Morty accidentally triggers the GPS’s emergency protocol. The tracker sparks violently and blurts out: \textcolor{red}{“WORM CONTAMINATION DETECTED! INITIATING SELF-CLEANSE!”})}  \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Morty:} “AHHHHH! Rick! The GPS is going crazy!”  \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Rick (Hologram):} “Oh, brilliant, Morty. You managed to infect the GPS with interdimensional worm goo. That’s a new low, even for you. Now it’s purging itself, which means it’s gonna wipe out half its functionality. Lucky for you, it’s leaving just enough to save your ass. But here’s the catch—you’re only getting data from three satellites now. You’ll have to make do!”  \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{(The GPS fires a hidden rocket, sending Morty hurtling uncontrollably through space. It spits out two sets of pings before finally breaking down completely.)}  \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “Okay, Morty, here’s what you’ve got. The GPS managed to record pings from three satellites before it totally crapped out. Here’s the data:” 
\[
\begin{aligned}
A_1 &= 28.21941442 \, \text{ms}, & A_2 &= 32.56521822 \, \text{ms}, \\
B_1 &= 37.40539321 \, \text{ms}, & B_2 &= 37.48077648 \, \text{ms}, \\
C_1 &= 21.88477974 \, \text{ms}, & C_2 &= 35.47581482 \, \text{ms}.
\end{aligned}
\]

\noindent \textbf{Rick:} “Oh, and the timestamps? The first set is at \(t_1 = 0 \, \text{s}\), and the second set is at \(t_2 = 5000 \, \text{s}\). That’s 5000 seconds, Morty, because worm goo screws with everything. Now, using just these three satellites, calculate your direction vector and velocity. Good luck, dumbass!”
\bigskip

\hl{$(b)$ Figure out the velocity vector using the distance data given.} \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{(After tumbling through space for what feels like an eternity, Morty finally crash-lands into Earth’s orbit. He breathes a sigh of relief, but the GPS splits into two pieces—a sun sensor and a magnetic field sensor.)} \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Morty:} “Oh man, Rick, the GPS is broken! What am I supposed to do now?!” \bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Rick (Hologram):} “Oh my god, Morty, you’re so useless! You’ve got a sun sensor, a magnetic field sensor, and a radio! Tape the sensors to your chest like the panicked idiot you are, and figure out your orientation relative to Earth. Then, send the data to ground control so they can save your sorry ass.”

\bigskip

\hl{$(c)$ Figure out how to use the sun and magentic sensors to figure out your orientation relative to Earth and include a sketch.} \bigskip
