	\section*{Question 1 - Bob's Search for the Hill of Happiness}
	Bob, in his insanity of life, is looking for a mountain, Korok, which claims to have the best weed in the world. However, to find it, he must first decode a map, and achieve his state of high.
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item The map was created by a sadistic being at 13:00 GMT on the 2nd of January, 1920 in honor of a great man born on that day. He used what us mortals now call the \textit{Fixed Frame}, which is defined as follows:
		\begin{center}
			\textit{The origin is the center of the Earth. The positive z-axis is the ray passing through the geographic north pole of the earth. The positive x-axis is in the direction of the vernal equinox, and the y-axis is taken as the right-hand cross product of the x and z axes.}
		\end{center}
		The coordinates in the map are $(3580.20,1105.36,5152.67)$ in \textit{km}. Convert these coordinates into latitude-longitude-altitude to find out where the hill is. In your answers, include sketches of both the Fixed Frame and the Latitude Longitude frame, as well as a marking of points. (Assume, \textbf{for the sake of the question,} that the x-axis of the\textit{ Fixed Frame} passes through the intersection of the prime meridian and the equator every 24 hours at 12:00 GMT).
		
		\item Bob is way too far away from this point to get to on foot, so he'll be using his teleporter. However, his teleporter requires \textit{Rotating Frame} coordinates, defined as follows:
		\begin{center}
			\textit{The origin is the center of the Earth, and the x-axis is in the direction of the intersection between the prime meridian and the equator from the center of the earth. The y-axis is the left-hand cross product of the x and z axes.}
		\end{center}
		Convert the latitude-longitude-altitude coordinates from the previous part into the \textit{Rotating Earth} frame. Now, if you were unable to complete the first part of this question, that's alright. The higher beings have decided to give you the latitude-longitude-altitude to a Hill of Slightly-Less-Happiness  $(28\degree21'12.8"N 75\degree35'36.7"E)$, which Bob is okay with. 
		
		\pagebreak
		
		\item Unfortunately, bob is now stranded in outer space because his teleporter actually works with the \textit{Sun Fixed Frame}, defined as follows:
		\begin{center}
			\textit{The z-axis passes through the center of the sun and is perpendicular to the orbital plane. The x-axis is in the direction of the vernal equinox passing through the center of the sun. and the y-axis is the cross product of the x and z axes.}
		\end{center}
		He is now \textit{inside the sun}. Given that today is the 17th of January, 2025, find out the new coordinates he should teleport to in order to make it back to orbit around the earth at an altitude of $200km$. \href{https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/}{Hint}
		
		\item Now that Bob is orbiting earth at an altitude of $200km$ sketch his reference frame so that the $x-axis$ is pointing down towards the earth and the $z-axis$ is in the direction of the orbit. Draw the orbit as well. 
		
		[Bonus] Find out how fast he has to spin in order for his eyes to continually point towards earth as he orbits.
	\end{enumerate}

	\section*{Question 2 - Bob's Fever Dream}
	Now that the weed has entered Bob's system, he's drifted into another plane. He's spiralling off of earth's surface and is now in an orbit with an altitude of $200km$. However, he wants to settle into an orbit at an altitude of $4206km$, using the least amount of energy. With his tiny rocket, he can only apply a burn of any impulse at three points in time. Find out the orbital transition and draw a diagram of where the burns should be made, and how much impulse should be provided. Hint:

	\section*{Question 4 - Bob's Cat}
	His cat has suddenly joined him. Measurements are taken every 0.5 seconds.
	\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
		\item Given the first $n$ positions ${(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ... , (x_n, y_n)}$, estimate the true position of the cat.
		\item Obviously, noting down every position and finding the exact position every time is unfeasible (because data, duh). Give us a new expression that uses the $(n-1)_{th}$ estimation and the $n_{th}$ measurement to estimate the true position of the cat.
		\item If the measurements for the first 5 seconds are:
		\begin{equation*}
			1,2,3,4,5
		\end{equation*}
	\end{enumerate}
